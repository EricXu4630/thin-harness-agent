# Thin Harness, Fat Skills

> *"The secret: thin harness, fat skills — a design pattern that separates intelligence work from execution work."*
> — Garry Tan, [Thin Harness, Fat Skills](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain/blob/master/docs/ethos/THIN_HARNESS_FAT_SKILLS.md)

**A live implementation of that architecture across Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini.**

The harness delegates everything possible to the provider APIs: web search, code execution, persistent containers, URL fetching, image generation, MCP connectors, Skills APIs, memory tools. The provider handles it. The harness just wires it together.

**~3,500 lines total. ~550 lines that actually execute anything.**

## Example: orchestration in action

**Setup:** Anthropic / claude-sonnet-4-6, with:
- MCP: GitHub (`https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/`) — one-click add in the MCP panel
- Skill: [brainstorming](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/main/brainstorming.md) — loaded from skillsmp.com
- Tools: ✅ Web Search  ✅ Memory  ✅ Bash Tool

**Prompt:** *"Find open issues in the thin-harness-agent repo, brainstorm solutions, and save a plan."*

The flow strip above the response builds up in real-time as tools fire:

```
① 🔌 github:list_issues  →  ② 🧠 brainstorming skill (L2 load)  →  ③ 🔍 web_search  →  ④ 🖥️ bash: write plan.md  →  ⑤ 🧠 memory: write
```

**What ran where:**

| Step | Tool | Ran on |
|---|---|---|
| ① | `github:list_issues` | GitHub's servers (Anthropic called MCP natively) |
| ② | Brainstorming skill triggers | Anthropic's servers (full SKILL.md loaded once at L2) |
| ③ | Web search | Anthropic's servers |
| ④ | `bash: cat > workspace/plan.md` | **Your machine** — harness ran it |
| ⑤ | `memory: write /memories/notes.md` | **Your machine** — harness wrote to disk |

The harness executed exactly two things (steps ④ and ⑤). Everything else was the provider or MCP server.

**Other quick-add MCPs in the sidebar:** Figma (`mcp.figma.com/mcp`), Vercel (`mcp.vercel.com`), Supabase (`mcp.supabase.com/mcp`), DeepWiki (free, no auth).

## Why this exists

Garry Tan's article defines the anti-pattern as a bloated harness with rigid tool definitions consuming context window. The right architecture is the inverse: fat skills encode domain knowledge and judgment; the harness stays thin enough to read in one sitting.

Most agent frameworks ignore this. They re-implement web search, code execution, filesystem access, and tool loops at the application layer — on top of capabilities the provider APIs already provide natively.

This repo tests how far the raw APIs take you with almost no scaffolding. The answer: surprisingly far. The only things the harness executes itself are memory writes and bash commands. Everything else — search, code, images, MCP calls, Skills — is delegated to the provider.

---

## What the provider handles — you just configure it

These run entirely on the provider's infrastructure. The harness passes a config flag. That's it.

| Capability | Anthropic | OpenAI | Gemini |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Web search** | `web_search_20260209` | `web_search_preview` | Google Search grounding |
| **Code / bash** | `code_execution_20250825`<br>bash+Python, 30-day container | `code_interpreter` (Python)<br>`shell` (bash, `/mnt/data`) | Python stateless (30s) |
| **URL fetch** | `web_fetch_20260209` | — | `url_context` |
| **Image generation** | — | `image_generation` (gpt-image-2) | — |
| **Maps / location** | — | — | `google_maps` |
| **MCP tool calls** | Native API, server-side | Native API, server-side | — |
| **Skills (SKILL.md)** | Native Skills API<br>progressive disclosure | `shell.environment.skills` | system prompt injection |
| **Memory tool** | `memory_20250818` | — | — |
| **Advisor tool** | `advisor_20260301` (beta)<br>Sonnet consults Opus mid-task | — | — |
| **Cross-session** | `container_id` (30d)<br>Files API (indefinite) | `previous_response_id` (30d)<br>Conversations API (indefinite) | local disk only |
| **Context window** | 1M tokens (Opus/Sonnet)<br>200K (Haiku) | 1M (gpt-5.5)<br>128K others | 1M+ all 2.5/3 models |

## What the harness does

The only code that *executes* anything:

| File | Lines | What it runs |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_manager.py` | ~250 | Writes to `memories/` when model calls `memory_20250818` |
| `workspace_executor.py` | ~300 | Runs bash commands in `workspace/` for Gemini |
| **everything else** | ~2,900 | Routing, config forwarding, UI, session state — nothing executed |

The three provider wrappers (`providers/*.py`, ~1,075 lines combined) are pure API forwarding. They build the request, stream the response, and relay events to the UI. They don't execute tools.

The local machine stores three directories:
- `memories/` — model's written memory (permanent)
- `workspace/` — bash sandbox for Gemini (permanent)
- `sessions/` — container IDs for cross-session persistence

All compute — inference, search, code execution, image generation — happens on the provider's infrastructure.

## How tool execution works

Tools in the UI are labelled **API** or **harness**. The distinction:

**API tools** — provider servers handle everything. Harness never sees the intermediate steps:
```
user message
  → harness sends request with tool config
  → provider executes internally (web search, code run, image gen...)
  → provider returns final answer
```

**Harness tools** — model generates a tool call, provider sends it *back* to the harness, harness executes locally, result goes back to the model. The `← harness` label shows this return flow:
```
user message
  → harness sends request with tool config
  → model decides to call: memory("write /memories/notes.md", "...")
  → provider returns the tool_call to the harness   ← execution comes back here
  → harness writes the file to disk
  → harness sends result back to provider
  → model sees result and continues
```

You use both the same way — enable the checkbox, ask naturally. The loop is handled automatically.

| Tool | Executes on |
|---|---|
| Web search | Provider servers |
| Code execution | Provider container |
| URL fetch | Provider servers |
| Image generation | Provider servers |
| MCP tool calls | Your MCP server (provider calls it) |
| `memory_20250818` | **Your machine** — `memories/` |
| `bash_20250124` | **Your machine** — `workspace/` |
| Gemini bash | **Your machine** — `workspace/` |

## AGENTS.md and memory

`AGENTS.md` (repo root) is the static system prompt, loaded on every call. Defines role, tools, behavior. You edit this — the model never writes to it.

`memories/AGENTS.md` is model-writable via `memory_20250818`. It accumulates learned preferences, facts, and context across sessions. The model reads it at session start to restore context.

```
session 1:  model learns something → writes memories/AGENTS.md
session 2:  model reads /memories → picks up where it left off
```

Works with Anthropic only (memory tool is Anthropic-native). OpenAI and Gemini rely on conversation history.

## Skills (SKILL.md standard)

Load any skill from a GitHub URL in the sidebar. The harness zips the SKILL.md and uploads it to the provider Skills API once, then caches the `skill_id`. After the first upload, only the `skill_id` is sent — the full content never appears in requests again.

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| First load | Harness zips SKILL.md, uploads to provider, caches `skill_id` locally |
| Every call after | Only `skill_id` sent — no content in the request |
| Progressive disclosure (Anthropic + OpenAI) | L1: name + description only (~100 tokens, always). L2: full SKILL.md, on trigger. L3: bundled resources, on demand. |
| Gemini | No native Skills API — full SKILL.md injected into system prompt every call |

Browse skills at [skillsmp.com](https://skillsmp.com).

## MCP servers

Add any public MCP server URL in the sidebar. Anthropic and OpenAI call your MCP server natively — server-side, no client loop. Gemini has no native MCP connector.

Test with a free public server: `mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp`

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EricXu4630/thin-harness-agent
cd llm-explorer
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --reload
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Enter your API key in the Provider panel. Keys are stored in `localStorage` — no server setup needed.

**Optional `.env` for server-side keys** (e.g. for Railway deployment):
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...
```

## Deployment

Configured for Railway out of the box:

```
web: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the Railway dashboard. Users can also enter keys directly in the UI without touching the server config.

> **Note:** Railway has an ephemeral filesystem — `memories/`, `workspace/`, and `sessions/` reset on redeploy. Add a persistent volume or external storage if you need cross-deploy memory.
